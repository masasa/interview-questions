# QUESTIONS FORM JOB INTERVIEWS

Throughout my job hunting I came across some intersting questions, some were easier than
others, some were harder but I always solved them all since I don't like leaving problems unsolved.

I will describe the problems as they were described to me in shortly and link you to my solutions.

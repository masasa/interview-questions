# QUESTIONS FORM JOB INTERVIEWS

Throughout my job hunting I came across some intersting questions, some were easier than others,<br>some were harder but I always managed to solve them all. I decided to share my solutions with<br>who ever seek for the answers to those problems, hopefully it will help someone.

I will describe the problems as they were described to me in shortly and link you to my solutions.

##Permutation of another

Given two strings you should return TRUE if one of them is permutation of another.<br>
<b>Assumptions:</b> additional space is allowed.

Example:
<ul>
<li>the string "math" and the string "tham" are permutations of one another.</li>
<li>the string "hakuna" and the string "matata" are NOT premutations of one another.</li>
</ul>

Attached solution for this problem [here](https://github.com/omrigami/interview-questions/blob/master/isPermutationOfAnother.java "Solution").

##Network Transfer Of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree (NOT a Binary Search Tree) we want to transfer it through the network in a way<br>that the other end of the network will be able to rebuild it exactly as it was before it was tranfered over the network.
<b>Assumptions:</b> additional space is allowed.
